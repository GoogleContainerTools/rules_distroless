## Reporting a Vulnerability

If it is not security critical, please open an [issue](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/rules_distroless/issues)

If it could be potentially exploited, or you are unsure if it can,
please report privately via github [(instructions)](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
and we will evaluate, fix and publish an advisory as necessary.
