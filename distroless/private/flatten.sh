    # For every prompt, therefore entry, we have write 31 bytes of data, one of which has to be either 'Y' or 'N'.
    # And the reason for it is that since we are not TTY and pretending to be one, we can't interleave write calls
    # so we have to interleave it by filling up the buffer with 31 bytes of 'Y' or 'N'.

    # To match the extraction behavior of tar itself, we want to preserve only the final occurrence of each file
    # and directory in the archive. To do this, we iterate over all the entries twice. The first pass computes the
    # number of occurrences of each path, and the second pass determines whether each entry is the final (or only)
    # occurrence of that path.
