A convience repository macro for apt rules.

This documentation provides an overview of the convenience repository macro around `package_index` and `resolve` repository rules.

### WORKSPACE Example

```starlark
load("@rules_distroless//apt:index.bzl", "deb_index")

deb_index(
    name = "bullseye",
    # For the initial setup, the lockfile attribute can be omitted and
    # generated by running
    #    bazel run @bullseye//:lock
    # This will generate the lock.json file next to the manifest file by
    # replacing `.yaml` with `.lock.json`.
    # If you explicitly want to run without a lock, set nolock to True to
    # avoid the DEBUG messages
    lock = "//examples/apt:bullseye.lock.json",
    manifest = "//examples/apt:bullseye.yaml",
)

load("@bullseye//:packages.bzl", "bullseye_packages")
bullseye_packages()
```

### BZLMOD Example

```starlark
apt = use_extension("@rules_distroless//apt:extensions.bzl", "apt")
apt.install(
    name = "bullseye",
    lock = "//examples/apt:bullseye.lock.json",
    manifest = "//examples/apt:bullseye.yaml",
)
use_repo(apt, "bullseye")
```

### Macro Expansion

This macro will expand to two repositories: `#name` and `#name#_resolve`.

### Typical Workflow

A typical workflow for `deb_index` involves the generation of a lockfile (`deb_resolve`) and the consumption of the lockfile by `deb_package_index` for generating a DAG.

#### Lockfile Generation

The lockfile generation can be on-demand by omitting the `lock` attribute. However, this comes with the cost of performing a new package resolution on repository cache misses.

While we strongly encourage users to check in the generated lockfile, it's not always possible because Debian repositories are rolling by default. Therefore, a lockfile generated today might not work later if the upstream repository removes or publishes a new version of a package.

If you explicitly want to run without a lock, set the `nolock` attribute to True to avoid the DEBUG messages.

#### Snapshot repositories

##### Debian
Users can still use a `snapshot` repository and check in the generated lockfiles. This is possible because `snapshot.debian.org` is an immutable point-in-time snapshot of the upstream repositories, meaning packages never get deleted or updated in a specific snapshot.

An example of this can be found at [/examples/debian_snapshot](/examples/debian_snapshot).

##### Ubuntu
Ubuntu also has a similar point-in-time snapshot service hosted at `snapshot.ubuntu.com`, which can be used similarly.

An example of this can be found at [/examples/ubuntu_snapshot](/examples/ubuntu_snapshot).
